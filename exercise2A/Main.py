"""
Exercise 2A:
Create a Python program that reads the data stored in the provided rainfall.txt, where each line
in the text file contains the name of a city, followed by whitespace, followed by the cityâ€™s annual
rainfall (in mm). Process this data so that it is grouped by annual rainfall into the following
categories: [50-60 mm), [60-70 mm), [70-80 mm), [80-90 mm), [90-100 mm], and then sorted
from lowest to highest rainfall within each category. Write this processed data to a new file
called rainfallfmt.txt, so that under each category the city name is centered in a field that is 25
characters wide and is in all uppercase letters. The city name should be followed by its rainfall,
right-aligned in a field that is 5 characters wide with 1 digit to the right of the decimal point.
